      <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> I'm Nozi, and it's my pleasure to introduce myself to you. I was born and bred in Qwaqwa, Free State.
        I did my schooling at Makabelane Technical High School and I'm now pursuing my BIT at the University of Pretoria.
        My strength is that I am always ready to take up new challenges and strive for excellence. 
        This is because I believe success and failures are the best way to sculpt ourselves to reach our goals.
        And I believe in myself and my hard work, and I want fulfillment in everything.

        My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills I'm academics,
        and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to be a renowned web-deloper in an organization and 
        reach the highest level of success. My moral is never to intend to harm anyone on purpose. </p>
